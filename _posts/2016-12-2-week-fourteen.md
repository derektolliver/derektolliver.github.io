### Lectures
I feel my experience in class was much better than most courses I've taken. It definitely takes some getting used to being randomly called upon, but it is a decent way to ensure that everyone is paying attention during the lecture or at least attempting to get them to. I can respect Downing's decision to do that. The quizzes were definitely a challenge at times because they were different than I'm used to, but I eventually acclimated  myself. Overall, I am very pleased with the sort of code tracing and conceptual ideas that were presented. I feel like I have a better understanding of not only the syntax of C++ but also a more solid foundation of constructors, pointers, etc. that I didn't feel as comfortable with before. 

### Projects
Though the projects seemed very daunting at first, I feel they were incredibly helpful. I think perhaps one of the best parts of this class is that Downing makes an effort to use many tools that are used the industry and are important in developing great software. It is something that is probably quite difficult to integrate and I appreciate that he goes out of his way to learn about them and include them in our material so that we can improve. Personally, I wish we could have maybe done some things involving open source or perhaps work on a bigger project like they do in SWE, but I'm honestly not sure of how it would work entirely. I do believe the projects we've worked on gave me a better understanding of OOP though, and in that regard they were very effective. I also enjoy that we were encouraged to work in teams. In the beginning I found the large amount of tools we were using (while helpful and important) to be slightly overwhelming, so being able to tackle them with others made me feel less confused.

### Exams
Though I feel the exams were very fair in their difficulty, I felt going into them that my understanding of what they would be like was somewhat vague. It would have been nice to know the format a little better. I know we were made aware it would be a certain number of questions and that we would be writing code, but I was really unsure of what to expect. With that in mind, I do believe they were an accurate test of our understanding of the information we were presented in class and in the projects.

### Conclusion
I love Downing as a professor and I very much enjoy the material of the course. I know I mentioned it previously but I truly do appreciate the fact that he makes an effort to stay up to date with the industry. As someone who wants to develop software, this is one of the few upper division courses in the department I've found that really benefits students in that regard as well as it does. I plan on taking SWE at some point before graduating not only because I enjoy him as a professor, but also because I believe the material he teaches will be very interesting and helpful in the future!
