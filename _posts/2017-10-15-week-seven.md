### What did you do this past week?
I spent my week preparing for the exam. It felt like it was difficult to find things to review
after a while. Once I went through all the concepts I felt like I could handle almost anything
that could have been asked about how to implement certain things or what the result of certain
input would give. In hindsight, I should have reviewed the readings more thoroughly. That is
where I felt the least prepared, but I had assumed I had them covered. However, I was still
pleased with the result of the exam so I feel good about how it all turned out.

### What's in your way?
This week I don't have any exams but a lot of work to get done. I really want to get most of IDB completed
this week so that is one of my main priorities. I have an exam next week though, so I need to be
able to find times to meet with my group/work around that. Hopefully it doesn't become too
overwhelming.

### What will you do next week?
I'll begin by finding time with my group to delegate our task load out. Then I will probably spend
time doing work for other courses so I can get that out of the way before diving into IDB.
I feel like it will be pretty involved and require a lot of attention so I don't see myself
jumping into it until I think I can make sufficient progress.

### What's my experience of the class?
After this first exam, I feel confident saying I prefer this class to OOP. I enjoyed being able
to implement solutions to problem on HackerRank a lot, which I didn't get in OOP. I'm sure its
implemented in that class as well, but I didn't get to use it when I took the course. I also
enjoy this material much more, and I can recognize each thing I learn/grasp in Python that I
didn't no before because I had a better understanding of the language going into the course,
which I'm happy about.

### Tip of the week:
My tip of the week is about credit! Before this year, I never used a credit card because of...well...mostly
fear. It's scary to me to think I could miss a small payment and be impacted negatively. However,
it's very important to develop credit as I'm sure many of you know. I recommend getting an
account at [Credit Karma](creditkarma.com). It's a good way to learn about what perks cards have,
what you can get approved for, and what can impact your credit in both positive and negative ways.
There are many sites like this, so I recommend you do your own research, but I've enjoyed using
this site so far.
