### What are your expectations of the class?
I'm expecting to have a much better understanding of Python by taking this course. I feel pretty comfortable with it, but I'm hoping to learn things that will give me a better understanding of the way it works and maybe some nice tips that I don't already know. I'm also hoping that the group projects provide me with a good experience, however I'm not so sure how I feel about them considering they are random. I was told it wasn't that way before and I feel like choosing one's group would make the project a much better experience for me personally.

### What did you do this past week?
I was unable to make it to the first class day to to the hurricane, so the only class I made it to was Friday's. I looked over the notes and Downing's website in order to get the information I needed, and asked peers who were able to make it to the class on Wednesday. I set up this blog for this class so that I can post to it regularly.

### What's in your way?
I'm still getting a balance of the new semester. This is the first time I've worked part time while going to school so I am trying to get the hang of how to spend/schedule my time.

### What will you do next week?
I'm going to try to get my optimize my work/school schedule so that I am not struggling to figure it out later. I'll also be reading what's necessary for classes and going over lecture notes to prepare for the quizzes.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience so far is limited, but I am excited! Python is my favorite language to write in, and I can't wait to learn more about it. I also very much like Downing as a professor (I had him for OOP), so I am excited to have him again. Hoping the semester goes very well :) (Except the projects aren't in groups so I'm really upset)

### Tip of the week:
My tip of this week is to sleep (more?) enough. I personally have had issues with my mental health (stress, annoyed, etc.) and have found that sleeping much more helps alleviate some of those issues. As students, I think we often don't get enough sleep and it's pretty terrible considering it can have such an impact on our academic performance.
