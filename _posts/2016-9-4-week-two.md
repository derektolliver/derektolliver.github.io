### What did I do this past week?
This week I began by getting the readings done so that I would be prepared for the quizzes. I made sure to read as much as I could before Monday in hopes of knowing all answers to the possible questions we could receive. I also started project one, Collatz, and made sure to get ahead on it because I figured it would take a fair amount of time.

### What's in your way?
I need to complete Collatz. I have done most of it, but I still need to finish writing tests and everything to have a fully complete submission. I also need to get ahead of the readings for next week so that I will have them done in time. I also

### What will you do next week?
I would like to have Collatz done before this weekend is over, so all I really need to do for the course is get the readings done. I will also be working on my resume to make sure it is up to date for the career fair that is coming up in a couple of weeks.

### Tip of the week:
My tip this week is about [Leetcode](www.leetcode.com)! Leetcode is an online judge, like UVa that we are using for our Collatz assignment, that hosts hundreds of technical interview problems for people to practice their skills. Since the career fair is coming up, it is probably a good idea to use websites like this one to your advantage in order to be sharp when interviews roll around. It even says what companies have used specific problems, so you can get an idea of what companies usually give their applicants. There are several websites like this, this is just the one I prefer. Other ones include [Codeforces](www.codeforces.com), [HackerRank](www.hackerrank.com), etc.
