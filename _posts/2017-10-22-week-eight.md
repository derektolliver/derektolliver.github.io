### What did you do this past week?
This week I spent most of my time doing work for other classes, but I was able to meet with my group and discuss how we were going to complete the next part of the project. I like that this project has a bit more emphasis on the backend of our DB as it brings some interesting problems to solve along with it.

### What's in your way?
I have a test this week so I need to be able to prepare for that while also working on IDB. Since this project seems more interesting I think I will enjoy the work to implement it more so, though.

### What will you do next week?
Next week my group will probably get ahead on the next project if we have the details of it. We will at least discuss what needs to be done/who will do what at a high level in preparation for it.

### What's my experience of the class?
I'm quite content with the course so far. I feel that the work is valuable and evaluated fairly. My only qualm is that I think the quizzes could be a little different. I think often times when I answer quizzes incorrectly it's because of the short amount of time, and I'm forced to answer without being able to fully think through the question. In that regard, I don't think the score I make on them accurately reflects my knowledge of the material. Perhaps if less of them were taken into account of our grade or something I could be a little bit happier about it.

### Tip of the week:
My tip this week is to apply to things early! Whether a job, graduate school, or an organization of time, make an effort to be an early submission. I have found while searching for a job after school I get much faster responses the earlier I apply to the opening. It also means once you've completed the application it's out of the way!
