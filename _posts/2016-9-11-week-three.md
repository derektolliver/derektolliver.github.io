### What did I do this past week?
I began my week by completing Collatz and getting all of my files turned in. I figured it would be a bit of a hectic experience because there is so much involved with the project. The integration of Travis, making sure you include the commit log, and having to fill out the .json are just a few of the items on the list that need to be remembered when submitting. I also worked on the readings to make sure I was prepared for any of the information that could be on the quiz.

### What's in your way?
A new assignment is being released so I need to make sure I fully understand what needs to be done for that. I also need to figure out who I will partner with because I want the bonus credit from it. I need to do a better job of finishing the readings faster. The articles aren't that difficult to read, but that combined with the book can be a bit consuming for me. I also need to finish preparation for the career fair that is coming up.

### What will you do next week?
This next week I need to make sure I get almost all of the second project completed. I don't want to be worrying about it next week while handling the career fair next week. I also have a test this week in another class though, so it might be difficult to get as much done as I would like. I think it would be cool to work on a personal project in C++ too, just to get a better idea of the language. But with all the things coming up in these next two weeks I'm not sure how feasible that will be.

### Tip of the week:
My tip this week is about [TechChrunch](www.TechChrunch.com). It is one of my favorite websites for news about the tech field and software development information. There is almost always something interesting to read about on there, especially if you are into tech stuff (which I would expect most people in this class to be). If you're looking for an interesting intro piece, [here](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/11/lovebot-tells-your-wife-you-love-her-so-you-dont-have-to/) is one I found while searching today about a new chatbot that sends messages to your loved ones so you don't have to. Maybe my girlfriend won't get mad at me anymore. (That's obviously a joke, Downing taught me that I should never get a girlfriend.)
