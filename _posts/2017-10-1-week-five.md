### What did you do this past week?
This week I had a test in another class I had to take so I started by finishing preparation for that.
After I took my exam I spent the rest of the time working on our group's IDB project. I feel pretty
good about the pace we went at, we were able to get almost the entire project done before the day it
was due so turning it in was just ensuring we had everything prepared. I like how everything turned
out, but I'm excited to get to work on the next assignment because we get to make the front end
a little nicer by using React and start creating a better backend. The project is very interesting
and a big reason I took this class. So far its been going quite well! :)

### What's in your way?
Currently I have some concerns about our exam coming up. I took OOP a couple of semesters ago but
I heard the format has changed, so I'm not really sure what to expect. I'm sure we will get information
before long, but I want to know how to prepare considering I just want to be ahead of the studying.

### What will you do next week?
I would like to know what the next IDB project will be like so the group can get an overview of all
of the tasks we need to complete but I'm not sure if we'll be told anything until the test is over.
I might start compiling a small review of the topics we went over in class to know what content I
need to study in preparation for the exam in a couple of weeks. Other than that I'll be spending most
of my time doing work and preparing for exams in other classes.

### What's my experience of the class?
As previously mentioned, I'm very happy about the IDB project. I think a huge reason I find it not
only interesting but also very worthwhile is it is a project you can learn a lot from and gain
experience that really will apply to the work I'll be doing in the future. Most academic assignments
have opportunities to learn things, but in my experience they aren't as hands on. We also get to use
many tools that simulate a true sort of workflow which I find really nice.

### Tip of the week:
My tip this week is something I should follow more often. I'm sure everyone has there own way of
studying, and I'm sure it varies for every course. However, I think one good way to prepare,
especially if done with a lot of time is to *PREPARE* your studying. By this I mean giving
yourself an overview of all of the topics, and any subtopics that go along with them. For
instance with this course, creating a checklist of every one of the concepts Downing has gone
over in class. Then when it comes time to study, one can just go through the list and sort of
create notes or go over the ones they've already taken, and it makes the studying not only seem
more organized but also ensures you avoid missing something important. Instead of just going
through old notes and not keeping track of what you've done, you can just refer to your sort
of overview you've created and make sure that everything has been reviewed.
