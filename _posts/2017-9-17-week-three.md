### What did you do this past week?
I started my week by finishing the readings so that I would be prepared for the quizzes. I think I
should be reading over the notes instead, as I feel that forgetting small things in class has lead
me to miss more points on the quizzes. I then finished working on Collatz. I had some issues with
queuing my build on the last day but it wasn't terribly bad. It also was much better than the semester
I took OOP so I think the new process is an improvement which is nice.

### What's in your way?
Career fair is over, but there are still career opportunities to pursue! Amidst going to class and
finishing assignments, I need to also be figuring out what I'm doing full time, and I'm not sure when
that will end. Luckily I don't feel like my workload is too consuming yet but we will see when exams
start to roll around.

### What will you do next week?
For this course there isn't a ton of work to do since Collatz is finished, so I will probably spend
most of my time working on other coursework. Between that and job opportunities I believe most of my
time will be taken up.

### What's my experience of the class?
The quizzes are taking a toll on me. I think I have only gotten full credit on two of them so far.
I don't do terribly bad, but I seem to miss one and I think I maybe rush through them too much.
I'm gong to work on reading through them more carefully and see if I can improve, because I always
know what I miss afterwards, I just kind of forget the exact trick to one of the questions.

### Tip of the week:
My tip of the week is to ensure that you are paying attention to timezones when talking to recruiters
and companies about internships/jobs. I tend to default to CDT for obvious reasons,
but if someone asks your availability be sure to be specific! Also, don't forget to clarify if they
don't specify. And take it into account when planning, of course.
