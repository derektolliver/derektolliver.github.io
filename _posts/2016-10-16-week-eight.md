### What did I do this past week?
I got sick this week, so I struggled to keep up with my homework. I still made it to every class but I found it very difficult to focus. After class instead of doing homework like I normally did, I immediately went home and rested in hopes I would get better faster. Luckily I did get some of my work done, just not nearly as much as I needed or had hoped for.

### What's in your way?
Because I got a little behind, I now have a lot of catching up to do. I haven't started allocator, so I will be doing that tomorrow. I also have a lot of work for other classes that needs doing, so I'll be spending my time making the most of my better health!

### What will you do next week?
Start allocator and finish it as soon as possible. Then I'm going to start preparing for the tests I have the week after, that way I don't have to worry about cramming for them or anything like that. I also have a lot of homework to get done so hopefully I can manage my time as effectively as possible.

### Tip of the week:
My tip of this week has to do with hackathons. I recommend having multiple if not several project ideas going into it. I went to HackRice this weekend and it was awesome! Luckily my partner and I had a couple of ideas so we had back up in case the first plan didn't work out like we wanted it to. As well as having multiple plans, think ahead! No one wants to go in blind and have to learn everything as they go. Make the most of the time you have there by having a general overview of what you plan to accomplish.
