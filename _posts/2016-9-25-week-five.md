### What did I do this past week?
This week was super busy with career fair events! I luckily didn't have as much school work so it wasn't too hectic. I finished Netflix on Tuesday and was able to focus on interviews and other schoolwork that needed to be done. All in all it was a solid week! Getting schoolwork done feels very productive but being able to have interview practice and possible internship opportunities is a great reminder that all the hard work that I put in is worth it.

### What's in your way?
Travis CI.

But really, it is kind of a pain to deal with. I love being able to utilize new tools that are very important to the industry but the struggles they give us with classwork make things more difficult than they could be sometimes. 

I also need to finish applying to companies online. A lot of cover letter writing is ahead of me!

### What will you do next week?
I have a test on Tuesday, so I'm finishing up the studying for that at the beginning of the week. Like I previously mentioned, I'll be focusing a lot on applying to companies and getting all the career related things out of the way so I can get back to focusing on school. And of course, as always, attempt to complete all of the readings for this week.

### Tip of the week:
My tip of the week this time is for [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/). If you're anything like me and you enjoy having pretty notes but also don't like the fact that typing them can sometimes limit their organization or what you're capable of, this might be something you'll be interested in. It's a Markdown editor that shows you a realtime version of the appearance of what you're typing with Markdown syntax. Obviously it can take some getting used to to ensure that you know all the important Markdown commands, but for simple things like headers, bullet points, etc. it can be very helpful. I also use it to edit these weekly blog posts! I just recently used it for the first time while taking notes in the Competitive Programming class on Friday and it was great! I'm a quick typer so I'm able to get a lot of information in during lectures or talks and being able to use the Markdown tools makes them look a lot nicer than using a word processor or text editor.
