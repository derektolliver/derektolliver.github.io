### What did I do this past week?
This week I focused on completing Life as soon as possible. On Darwin I was struggling to complete all of my tests on the due date and I didn't want to risk that happening again on this project, so I tried to finish it by Wednesday. Though I didn't quite get it done as soon as I had hoped, my partner and I completed it sooner than right before the due date. :)

### What's in your way?
Though a holiday is coming up this week, I don't want to be unprepared by the week after so I do have some studying/work to complete. I have a paper due for another class the week after this one and I have the test in this class, so I am going to attempt to get work done for both of those classes.

### What will you do next week?
I am going to attempt to have all the assignments for the week after Thanksgiving completed, work on my essay, and study for OOP. I'm confident I can get a good amount of it done at home since I'll be so bored while I'm there. I'm also trying to find open source projects that I'm interested in so I can work on those. We'll see how much I get done.

### Tip of the week:
Somewhat in relation to my list tip last week, I have another recommendation on reading material. This week it's about a fairly popular website many of you have probably heard of, [Medium](https://medium.com). I have been getting into reading a lot more recently, as I feel it allows me to learn about opinions and knowledge that other people have and I think everyone should too! Especially about topics you care about.
