### What did you do this past week?
This week was filled with a lot of work for each of my classes, mostly IDB. I spent time figuring out how to use Postman in order to meet the requirements in the project regarding our tests. We had some issues with GCP so we also had to diagnose and fix those in order to prevent our site from failing in any way.

### What's in your way?
The next couple weeks before Thanksgiving break will be pretty stressful, I think. There's going to be some tests, a lot of work, and another IDB project to work on. It feels like there isn't much time to relax but it'll be nice when it's all over. The next IDB project is somewhat interesting as well, so hopefully that is an enjoyable experience. I am somewhat concerned about the quality of another team's API and how usable it would be, though.

### What will you do next week?
Since IDB is done for now I will spend most of my time preparing for an exam I have next week. Due to how busy the past couple of weeks have been, I haven't been able to focus on the material for that class so I will have some catching up to do.

### What's my experience of the class?
I haven't been enjoying the past few classes too much. I have done poorly on the quizzes because of the SQL material, as well. I think Downing does a good job of going through things but I don't know how conducive it is to my learning experience, specifically. When we spent a little time in class writing our own queries, I felt that I actually understood them somewhat well. When we just went through and talked about each one he asked of us, I think some of it didn't really sink in. Needless to say, this next exam will require some extra preparation on my part in order to do well.

### Tip of the week:
I'm sure someone else has talked about this already, but I recently transitioned to using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and I really like it. I have always used Atom before I switched, and I think I prefer VSCode a little more. The issues I've had with Atom in the past regarding some of the bugs or crashes it would give me have not happend at all. They are somewhat similar, but I think I prefer the aesthetic of VSCode slightly more. I think it's important to try everything to figure out what working environment is best for you.
