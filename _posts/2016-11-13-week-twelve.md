### What did I do this past week?
This week was filled with a lot of work on Life. Because we were taught things throughout the week that applied to the project, there was a bit of going back and editing the current form of what was written in order to introduce changes that would make the code more correct or better, i.e. adding virtual where necessary and things of that nature.

### What's in your way?
I think I'm almost done with Life but I'm not entirely sure how much longer it will take me and my partner. And even if our code is almost fully functional, there will still be many unit tests to write and code to fully document so that's ahead of me. I also have the weekly homework I always have to work around, as well as some work to do towards interview processes and the like.

### What will you do next week?
The goal is to complete Life as soon as possible in order to avoid feeling rushed by Thursday. Between that and getting work done for other classes I have a fair bit of business ahead of me. I also would like to begin studying for final exams soon in order to stay ahead of material and review things I've forgotten, but that may be pushing it with the amount of time I'll have.

### Tip of the week:
My tip this week is probably known to many but it's something I recently got into and has become something I spend a fair amount of my time doing: Browsing [Quora](https://quora.com). There are many questons I view about a range of topics, but some are specific to SWE and programming in general. I think it's interesting to learn things about the industry I've never heard about before, or things about life in general. It has replaced [Reddit](https://reddit.com) for me and I find it hard to go back. So if you have an inquisitive mind and enjoy learning about random stuff go nuts!
