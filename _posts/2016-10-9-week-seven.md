### What did I do this past week?
I had three tests on Thursday, so almost all of this week was dedicated to preparing for those. It meant I had to keep myself busy every second of the day almost, but I think I made a productive use of my time. I have also been working on applying to other companies for internships, so things like writing cover letters and maintaining contact with recruiters have been taking up a fair bit of my time as well.

### What's in your way?
Because I spent all of last week studying, I wasn't able to stay ahead of the assignments I have due this week. So after I finish taking care of all of those, I will hopefully get started on this next project. I don't have a partner as of yet either, so I hopefully will find myself one of those!

### What will you do next week?
I need to finish all of the busy work ahead of me currently and hopefully get a head start on Project Three. I will also finally submit the bulk of my applications for internships (A little later than I was hoping for) so that I can find all possible opportunities!

### Tip of the week:
This week my tip is about upcoming hackathons (HackRice, HackTX), or those that happen at any time really. I know a lot of people are not into them, but they are a great way to really beef up your resume, learn how to work with a team, and use new tools! Just the experience itself is something recruiters/interviewers would love to hear about. I can speak from recent experience, in almost all interviews I've had they ask about teams I've worked with, projects I've worked on, troubles I've ran into, etc. With experiences like hackathons, one would easily be able to talk an interviewer's ear off! :)
