### What did you do this past week?
I spent a little time thinking about what our group should do for our project. We also waited to
find a fifth member to join. Eventually we found our fifth and decided on the topic of video games.
I think it's decent, but I do believe we maybe could have found something better. It's not terribly
important to me though. I'm excited to make real progress on it! :)

### What's in your way?
At the moment it's kind of tough to find good times to meet up with my group. Between school and work
I don't have a ton of time for random meet ups, but luckily this weekend we will be getting together
to plan and work on some things.

### What will you do next week?
I'll begin by working with my group to figure out how we will be splitting up our work that's due this
week. I'll also be studying for a test that I have Tuesday. After that's done, I can make sure to
complete whatever work needs to be done for this and other classes.

### What's my experience of the class?
The quizzes were a little better this week so that makes me happy. I enjoy all the things we're learning
about in Python so I'm enjoying that aspect a lot. I feel like it's going to start be overwhelming,
balancing between the work on the project and the content of lectures. I'm a little worried about that
going forward, but I suppose it's just another challenge to overcome.

### Tip of the week:
My tip this week is to drink more water! This may be my most important tip I've ever given. We don't
drink enough water to maintain a healthy level of hydration! Get a water bottle and take it with you
to campus so you can refill it. If you don't like drinking tap water, get a Brita. Take care of
yourselves!
