### What did you do this past week?
This week I spent most of my time preparing for a test I have next week. I've spent some time looking into ways we can improve/refactor IDB but I plan on spending time over the holidays doing that since I don't have much to do.

### What's in your way?
I feel like I will need to do a lot to prepare for this upcoming exam. I don't know the SQL queries that well so I will have to spend time really trying to understand how I can use those well in order to feel confident answering whatever I may be asked.

### What will you do next week?
I'll spend time over the holiday break refactoring what I can in IDB. It'll probably involve some changes in our backend that could use improvements, and possibly increased levels of testing. I feel confident that our API is ready to be requested by another group already.

### What's my experience of the class?
I have liked the recent refactoring we have been doing in class. It's very interesting to see how Downing covers handling certain changes and how to go about solving them. However, I think it would have been helpful if during the beginning of this section of the course he addressed what you want/don't want. This would involve just breifly going over things such as compile time vs runtime errors, things like that.

### Tip of the week:
With the holiday breaks coming up, I think it's important to mention that the break from school is a great time to work on a personal project of any kind that can be added to your resume. I know many people go on vacation but I also have found it difficult to find time to work on things during the semester, so if you have time over break to work on something you're interested in that you think could benefit you, definitely go for it! It's always a good use of your time even if it doesn't get fully completed.
