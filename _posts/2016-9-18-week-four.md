### What did I do this past week?
I started the Netflix project with my partner. Because we started so early, we've made great progress and should be done soon. I also had tests in other courses so I was putting a lot of work in other areas.

### What's in your way?
I need to finish Netflix. I already have achieved an RMSE of 1.00 so my partner and I just need to find ways we can optimize it. We have ideas of what to do but we haven't put them in practice, so we shall see how it goes. It would be nice to get the bonus points for getting it under the target RMSE but I'm not sure how possible that is.

### What will you do next week?
This next week should be calmer than the last since I don't have any tests. I hope to utilize the sort of "grace period" as a way to get ahead on things I need to get done. I also am going to the career fair so I'm hoping that ends up going well! It would be great if I was busy with the results of that event. :)

### Tip of the week:
This week my tip is about [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com). This website allows you to type your resume into a template so that you don't have to worry about making some special word document or finding one online and trying to make sure it's compatible with your editor. It also stores it online so you always have a place to access it if necessary. I also know of people who use this tool as a way to type up specific homework projects that require special fonts or characters, like those used in specific maths. It makes creating those documents a breeze, and it's completely free!
