### What did I do this past week?
This week I had a lot of homework alongside the completion of Darwin. I was so busy the week prior I wasn't even able to start, so this week was spent focusing on that. It was definitely a lot different from our other projects in that we were given very little starter code. While having some benefits, this also meant it required more time than the other projects (at least for me) which made things a little stressful.

### What's in your way?
I have a good amount of homework while also being given Project 5, so I want to get ahead on that. I also had to miss one of the classes last week because of an interview, so some of the things we went over on Wednesday and Thursday weren't super clear to me. I need to go over those things a little bit more to feel comfortable with them.

### What will you do next week?
After I complete all the assignments for my other classes I'm going to begin the fifth project. I would ideally have it almost complete by next week, but I haven't really read over it yet so I'm not entirely sure what is in store for me. At least I don't have tests coming up, so I don't have to worry about their being conflicts with those.

### Tip of the week:
My tip of the week is about makings [gifs](www.gifs.com). This is a website that allows you to make gifs out of youtube videos simply by adding gif to the beginning of the link, ex: gifyoutube.com/youtubelinkhere. It was made by three guys who dropped out of Harvard and moved to the bay, which comes with a pretty interesting story. You can read about it [here](https://medium.com/@roryoreilly/harvard-to-homeless-all-because-of-animated-gifs-ca6a918baccd#.wt3636hdt).
